<P><EM>Note:</EM> Since the Atmos doesn't have working disk I/O
(see 
<A HREF="atmos-6.html#limitations">section &#34;Limitations&#34;</A>), the
available drivers cannot be loaded at runtime (so the term "loadable drivers"
is somewhat misleading). Instead, the drivers have to be statically linked. While
this may seem overhead, it has two advantages:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The interface is identical to the one used for other platforms
and to the one for the Atmos once it has disk I/O.</LI>
<LI>Once disk I/O is available, existing code can be changed to load drivers
at runtime with almost no effort.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>The names in the parentheses denote the symbols to be used for static linking of the drivers.</P>

<DT><B><CODE>atmos-228-200-3.tgi (atmos_228_200_3)</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This driver was written by Greg King and Stefan Haubenthal.
It features a resolution of 228&times;200 with a palette of two colors that
can be chosen from the Atmos's eight colors.  The driver supports a third
palette-"color" that actually "flips" the pixel (it becomes the other color)
that is on the screen under the graphics cursor.</P>

<DT><B><CODE>atmos-240-200-2.tgi (atmos_240_200_2)</CODE></B><DD>
<P>This driver was written by Stefan Haubenthal and Greg King.
It features a resolution of 240&times;200 with black and white colors.
It is the default graphics driver for the Atmos.</P>

<P>
<DL>

<DT><B><CODE>atmos-pase.joy (atmos_pase)</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Supports two standard joysticks connected to the P.A.S.E. interface of the Atmos.</P>

<P>No mouse drivers are currently available for the Atmos.</P>

<P>
<DL>

<DT><B><CODE>atmos-acia.ser (atmos_acia)</CODE></B><DD>
<P>Driver for the Telestrat integrated serial controller and the Atmos with a
serial add-on.
Note that because of the peculiarities of the 6551 chip together with the
use of the NMI, transmits are not interrupt driven, and the transceiver
blocks if the receiver asserts flow control because of a full buffer.</P>
