AltInput - an alternate line input routine
for cc65
by Joseph Rose, a.k.a. Harry Poter
------------------------------------------
*	Should compile for most targets
*	Simply compile this module with your
	program and call the GetInput()
	routine, passing a pointer to the
	text buffer in In and the max. len.
	in InLen.
