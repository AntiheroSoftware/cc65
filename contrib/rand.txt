--------------------------------------------------
To replace the normal function, just include the
rand.s file into your program at the command line.

For a modified random number (i.e. a number
facored into the random number generator) use the
function w/ prototype:

	int __fascall__ rand2 (int);

Pass to the function the number to factor to
rand2().
