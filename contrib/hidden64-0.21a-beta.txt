Hidden64 Beta Version 0.21
By Joseph Rose, a.k.a. Harry Potter

Upgraded to cc65 Snapshot 12.13.9
------------------------------------------
Hidden64 is a cc65 library for C64 programmers that provides near-direct
access to the 12k of RAM behind the I/O and kernal ROM of a C64 normally
inaccessible to cc65 programs.  It also provides access to the tape
buffer as BSS RAM.  This version is incomplete.  In particular, the manual
and example program are incomplete and I should eventually add more
functions and examples to the library.  However, it works!
------------------------------------------
I look forward to any feedback regarding this software.  You can e-mail me
at my new address: rose.joseph12@yahoo.com.
