MemBank128 v. 0.10 Beta
by Joseph Rose, a.k.a. Harry Potter
-----------------------------------
Expands the available memory on the C128 as follows:

*	Your code operates in Bank 0, giving you 56k to play with.  All
	kernal/IO access will be delegated.
*	Allows the use of "low RAM" (the first 7k of Bank 0/15) for data.
	You can put code and initialized data in the 2.25k application
	buffer.
*	You can use Bank 1 for data.  You can load initialized data into
	Bank 1.

These give you 118k+ available RAM, as opposed to cc65's normal 41k, and I
deem this as magic.

Limits:
-------
*	This is a beta version.  Not all library functions are implemented.
	Unimplemented modules are in the distribution's deflib\ directory.
*	Some functions may not be fully debugged.
*	Far memory allocation is not available.
